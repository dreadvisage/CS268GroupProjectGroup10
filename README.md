# CS268GroupProject

## Database Config
Using PHPMyAdmin, create a database named "cs268database" or whatever you want really. 
Then using the included .sql file included in the project root, import those tables inside of that database.
Then all you have to to is ensure your "secrets.php" have the correct database name (the one created).
