            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <ul>
                <h3>How do I play Warhammer 40k?</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Warhammer 40k has many rules due to the large amount of factions and units, each with thier
                    own unique abilities and stats. Therefore, it is important that you first understand the 
                    core rules of 40k. Click this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s3xJudBU2dw" target="_blank">link</a> 
                    to watch a video on the basics of Warhammer 40k.

                <h3>How do I choose my first faction?</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>Once you have learned the basic rules of 40k, the next step is to choose a faction/army to play
                    as. Because purchasing models can be costly, it is important to pick a faction that you will enjoy
                    for a long time. We recommend that you browse the Factions section of INSERT NAME HERE to find a 
                    faction that interests you design and/or lore wise. Once you think you have found a desirebale faction,
                    you could watch YouTube videos of that army in action. This will help you get an idea of how the army plays,
                    and get a better understanding of the core rules of 40k. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PlayOnTabletop/videos" target="_blank">Play On Tabletop</a> 
                    has many games available to watch, but there are many more channels that showcase games and provide information of any faction.
                </ul>

                <h3>How do I create an army list?</h3>
                <ul>
                <li>After choosing a faction, you will now want to build a list of units that will make up the army you bring to the
                    table. The first thing you should do is read these 
                    <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2023/03/30/how-army-building-works-in-the-new-edition-of-warhammer-40000/" target="_blank">official rules</a> 
                    on how to build an army, as there are some restrictions as to what you can include in your list. Be sure to be careful and read the rules to full
                    understanding, as you don't want to waste money on a unit you can't use. After, you can return to INSERT NAME HERE and find the index for your faction in the
                    Indexes tab. Each index includes the datasheets for that factions specific units, as well as the rules and abilities for the army. Finally, you can once again return
                    to INSERT NAME HERE and utilize our beginner freindly army builder. Find your faction in the Points tab, and then begin to add units to your list. The list can be found
                    on your account page, and for each unit added, the total army point score will be added up.
